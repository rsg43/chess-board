# Chessboard

This is a very basic chessboard, with functionality for 2 sets of pieces (black
and white) and subset of actual pieces (bishops and knights). Main class has
functionality to setup a board, then play a turn based game (as seen by
by running python3 example.py)

Please note, pytest will need to be installed for tests, otherwise all other
dependencies are stdlib with python3.12.

If I had a bit more time I would create a container for the dependencies, but
wanted to focus on functionality and tests first.
